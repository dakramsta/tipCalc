# tipCalc

Heya!
This was the project for the Tip Calculator test in swift using Xcode. I would like to participate in the Codepath IOS Course with Capital One.

PROCESS:
I finally fixed some bugs had to do with Xcode 7.2 - removed the program and installed 7.3. Working correctly.
I also fixed some of the old syntax form the video

TIMING:
The second time I did this, it took a little under 3 hours total if I include messing around with Github. 

All good! Let me know if i'm still able to join:)
